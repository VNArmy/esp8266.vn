# Giới thiệu
The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) requires an increasing number of nodes to connect to the Internet. However, only a limited number (usually fewer than 32) of nodes can directly connect to the same router. Therefore, Espressif has developed the ESP-MESH protocol to solve this problem. In a mesh network, the nodes can establish a network and forward packets. As a result, a large number of nodes can connect to the Internet without any improvements of the current router.
